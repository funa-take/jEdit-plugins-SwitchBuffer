		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		The SwitchBuffer plugin is a must for any programmer who hates to take his/her hands
		off the keyboard, while wanting to switch buffers.  This plugin is similar to the
		iswitchb library in emacs. The underlying theme behind each, is that you can type
		part of a buffer name and only those buffers whose names contain the string you have
		typed, are shown in the buffer list. You can then hit enter to switch to the first buffer
		in that list.

		<h2>Usage</h2>
		Nothing much to it.  You open the SwitchBuffer dialog by selecting the 'Show Switch Buffer' menu item
		from the SwitchBuffer menu.  The dialog will list all the buffers that you have currently have open.
		The textbox at the top of the dialog (which is given focus automatically) is there to type the name
		of the buffer that you want to switch to.  The list of buffers below is correspondingly updated to
		feature only those buffers whose names contain what you have typed.
		The first buffer in the list is always selected. Hit <b>Enter</b> or click on the buffer name with
		the <b>left mouse button</b> to switch to that buffer.  Use the <b>up/down</b> arrow keys or the
		shortcuts <b>alt+i / alt+k</b> to select the previous and next buffers respectively. Buffers can
		also be closed directly from within the SwitchBuffer dialog by pressing <b>ctrl+w</b> or by clicking
		on the buffer name with the <b>right mouse button</b>.

		<p>SwitchBuffer also provides another way of switching buffers.  This is called a 'File Suffix Switch'.
		As the name suggests, this options allows you to switch buffers based on the suffix (the extension)
		of the buffer name.  If you select this option from the SwitchBuffer menu, SwitchBuffer with take the
		name of the currently active buffer and attempt to find any other open buffers with the same first
		part of the file name (the part before the dot '.') but with different extensions (e.g index.html
		and index.js).  If only one other buffer is found, SwitchBuffer will switch to that buffer automatically,
		if more than one is found, the SwitchBuffer dialog is displayed to allow you to choose the buffer that you
		want.</p>

		<p>SwitchBuffer works really well if you assign either of the above options to a shortcut in the
		jEdit 'Global Options' so that you can operate it from the keyboard.</p>

		<p>If configured to do so (see below), SwitchBuffer also remembers your previous buffer and displays
		that buffer name in the text field, so you can simply switch to the previous buffer that you were in
		by hitting <b>Enter</b>.  This is configurable to allow SwitchBuffer to only remember the previous buffer
		if switched using SwitchBuffer, or to allow it to remember the previous buffer you were using no matter
		how it was accessed (by using jEdit's buffer switcher for example).  The SwitchBuffer dialog also
		remembers the size and position that the user previously set for it.</p>

		<h2>Options</h2>
		<h3>General options:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>On loss of focus, hide switchbuffer window: </b> This option determines what the SwitchBuffer
			dialog does when it looses focus. If ticked, the dialog will disappear if it looses focus, if not,
			the dialog will remain visible.  This option can come in useful if you use an environment where the
			mouse cursor determines the window that gets the focus.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Filename matching options:</h3>
		There are a number of filename matching options available.  These are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Beginning of filename: </b> This will only match filenames from the beginning of the name.  For example,
			if I have four files open - 'Shape.java', 'Circle.java', 'TestCircle.java' and 'build.xml' and I type 'Circle'
			into SwitchBuffer, only the file 'Circle.java' will be matched.</li>
			<li><b>Anywhere in filename: </b> This will match filenames from anywhere in the name.  For example,
			if I have the same four files open - 'Shape.java', 'Circle.java', 'TestCircle.java' and 'build.xml' and I
			type 'Circle' into SwitchBuffer, both 'Circle.java' and 'TestCircle.java' will be matched.</li>
			<li><b>Sub Sequence match: </b> This option implements the subsequence algorithm : The empty string is a
			subsequence match of any string.  The string aX where a is a character and X is a string is a subsequence
			match of Y if a occurs in Y, and the substring of Y after the first occurrence of a is a subsequence match of X.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ignore case: </b> This is default behavior. The case of the string you enter is ignored.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>File list options:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Show buffer icons: </b> This is default behavior. The state icons of the buffers are shown next
			to their names. Uncheck this if you work on a slow computer and the dialog renders slowly.</li>
			<li><b>Show files in the colours defined by the file system browser: </b> If you have defined any colours
			in the jEdit file system browser, checking this setting will list the files in the SwitchBuffer dialog
			using those colours.</li>
			<li><b>Show directories: </b> This determines whether SwitchBuffer will display the directory of the buffers
			in the file list.</li>
			<li><b>Crop common directory: </b> If the above 'Show directories' option is checked, checking this option
			will remove any common directories from the beginning of the directories displayed by SwitchBuffer and only
			show the parts that differ. This is useful if the files being edited are in a deep directory tree and the
			end of the path is more important than the beginning in determining which file to select in the file list.
			If this option is checked, the cropped directory will be displayed in the title bar of the SwitchBuffer dialog.</li>
			<li><b>Remove currently active buffer from list: </b> This option will stop the currently active buffer (the
			buffer you are currently working on in the jEdit text area) from appearing in the list of files that appear
			in the SwitchBuffer dialog.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Previously open buffers:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Remember previous buffer: </b> This option will make SwitchBuffer automatically remember the text that
			you enter in the textbox at the top of the SwitchBuffer dialog.</li>
			<li><b>...even if not switched by SwitchBuffer: </b> The above option will remember the file name of previous
			file only if switched using SwitchBuffer.  This option will make SwitchBuffer listen for when the buffer is
			changed using other means.  This means that SwitchBuffer will always display the last accessed buffer in the
			textbox no matter how it was switched. </li>
			<li><b>Remember any text entered: </b> If SwitchBuffer isn't configured to remember the last accessed buffer
			(using the above two options), this option will make SwitchBuffer remember any text entered in the textbox.</li>
		</ul>
