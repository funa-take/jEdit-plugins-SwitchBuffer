SwitchBuffer Plugin Change Log
:noTabs=false:folding=explicit:collapseFolds=1:

{{{ version 1.1.1

{{{+ enhancements:
 - Updated to the new jEdit 4.2 API.  Now requires jEdit 4.2 pre 4
}}}

}}}

{{{ version 1.1.0

{{{+ enhancements:
 - Implemented a file suffix switch.  If invoked, SwitchBuffer will look
   for any other open buffers that have the same name as the current
   buffer, but with a different suffix.  If only one other buffer is found
   SwitchBuffer will switch to that buffer automatically, otherwise the
   SwitchBuffer dialog will be displayed allowing the user to select the
   buffer they want.

 - Added the ability to display the list of open buffers in the colours
   defined by the jEdit file system browser.  This is a configurable
   option.

 - Added the option to configure what happens when the SwitchBuffer
   dialog loses focus.  The window can be hidden or remain visible.

 - Added the ability to open buffers using a click of the left mouse
   button

 - Added the option to remove the currently active buffer from the list
   of files displayed.

 - Added the ability to close the buffers listed in the file list.
   This functionality is bound to the CTRL-W key combination or by
   right clicking on a buffer name in the list.

 - Added the option to allow SwitchBuffer to listen for EditBus message
   to trap when the buffer is changed by some other means.  This means
   that SwitchBuffer will always display the last accessed buffer in
   the textbox no matter how it was accessed.

 - If SwitchBuffer is not configured to remember the previous buffer
   opened, an option has been added to make it remember any text entered
   into the textbox.

 - Added two new filename matching options:
   + match only at the beginning of the filename.
   + perform a subsequence match on the filename.

 - Add the option to configure whether to display the directories of the
   open buffers in the file list.

 - If directories are being displayed, added the option to crop common
   directories.  This is useful if the files being edited are in a deep
   directory tree and the end of the path is more important than the beginning
   in determining which file to select in the file list.

 - Updated the text on the buttons to make them more consistent with other
   jEdit dialogs.

 - General tidy up of option pane.

{{{ initial release - version 1.0.0

{{{ + features:
 - Dialog displayed allowing the user to enter the name of an open buffer.

 - The list of buffers below is correspondingly updated to feature only those
   buffers whose names contain what you have typed. The first buffer in the
   list is always selected.

 - The highlighted buffer can be selected by hitting the enter key.

 - The up/down keys or the shortcuts alt+i/alt+k can be used to select the
   previous and next buffers displayed in the list.

 - The previous buffer is remembered and displayed in the text field, so you
   can simply switch to the previous buffer that you were in by hitting Enter.

 - The SwitchBuffer dialog also remembers the size and position that the user
   previously set for it.

 - Options to ignore case of the file typed in and to show the buffer icons of
   the open buffers displayed in the list.
